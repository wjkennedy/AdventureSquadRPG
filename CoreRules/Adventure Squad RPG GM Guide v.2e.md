# Adventure Squad RPG GM Guide v.2e


## 📖 Chapter 1: Welcome to Adventure Squad

### What Is Adventure Squad?

Adventure Squad is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) where players become heroic animals who go on exciting missions together. They might rescue someone in trouble, solve a mystery, or explore a spooky cave. Everyone has a part to play, and together, the group becomes the Adventure Squad!

The game is easy to learn, fast to play, and focused on fun, teamwork, and solving problems in creative ways. Players roll a six-sided die (a d6) to try things, and the Game Master (or GM) guides the story and controls the world.

If you’ve ever imagined being a clever fox inventor, a brave penguin explorer, or a talking turtle who drives a submarine—this game is for you.

You will need:

- Dice (d6s for players, full set for you)
- Getalong Tokens (buttons, coins, stickers)
- Index cards (for NPCs or clues)
- Paper or whiteboard for sketching maps
- This book—or a printed summary sheet!

---

### What Does a Game Master Do?

As the Game Master, you’re the guide, narrator, and referee. You tell the story and bring the world to life. You’ll describe what the heroes see, hear, and experience. You’ll play the characters they meet. And you’ll decide when a challenge needs a dice roll.

Being a GM is a little like being the director of a movie mixed with being a storyteller. You don’t need to memorize everything—you just need to keep the game moving, help everyone have fun, and be ready to say, “That sounds awesome! Roll for it!”

Your job isn’t to trick the players or beat them. It’s to challenge them in a way that feels fair, exciting, and rewarding. You set up the puzzles—they solve them. You describe the danger—they find a way through.

When in doubt, use the dice, be fair, and cheer for every good idea.

---

### What’s New in Adventure Squad 2nd Edition?

This edition keeps the best parts of the original game and adds more tools for you to build awesome stories. Here’s what’s new:

* **Player Simplicity, GM Power** – Players still use a single d6 and five easy stats. You, as GM, can now use the full set of RPG dice (d4 to d20) for extra flavor and flexibility.
* **Turn-Based Action** – Each hero gets a turn. You decide what order makes sense—just keep it fair.
* **Better Pacing Tools** – New story structures, clearer rules for danger and discovery, and guidance on scaling tension.
* **Getalong Tokens, Team Bonuses, and New Challenges** – The heart of Adventure Squad is teamwork, and now you’ve got more ways to reward it!

---

### What Makes Adventure Squad Special?

**It’s not about fighting.** In this game, conflict is about solving problems, not defeating enemies. There are no hit points or damage charts. If someone’s in trouble, your players help them. If someone’s being mean, your players outsmart or outfriend them.

**It’s about heart.** Every pup, bunny, bear, or bat in Adventure Squad has strengths—and they all have something to learn. The best players don’t just win the day—they lift each other up.

**It’s for everyone.** Whether your players are new to RPGs or experienced storytellers, the rules are designed to be flexible and kind. There's always room for cool ideas.

---

### What’s in This Book?

This guide gives you everything you need to run your own games, even if you’ve never done it before. Here’s a sneak peek of what’s ahead:

* How to build your own stories and worlds
* How to run smooth turns with just a few rules
* How to handle tricky moments like “What if they skip the clues?” or “What if they want to build a robot hot air balloon?”
* Tools, charts, and ideas to help you keep things moving
* Ready-to-use adventure seeds and NPCs

---

### One Last Thing…

You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t need to know every rule. You just need to care about your players and be ready to say, “Yes, and…”

The world of Adventure Squad is waiting. Let’s get started.

---

Here’s the full draft of **Chapter 2: How to Run a Game** for Adventure Squad 2E:

---

## 🎬 Chapter 2: How to Run a Game

Running Adventure Squad is like hosting the best kind of playdate—it’s full of imagination, excitement, and teamwork. As the Game Master (GM), you help your players shine. You set the scene, play all the characters who aren’t the heroes, and make sure everyone has fun and feels included.

Let’s walk through what you need to run a game of Adventure Squad like a pro.

---

### 🎲 Your Tools

You don’t need a lot of stuff to run this game. Here’s a quick checklist:

* A **six-sided die (d6)** for each player
* Your **GM dice set**: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20
* Printed or written **character sheets**
* A **notebook or sheet of paper** for notes
* This book (or your own awesome notes!)
* Some **tokens or markers** for Teamwork and Getalong (buttons, coins, or cards work great!)
* Optional: A whiteboard, index cards, or map tiles for visuals

---

### 🧠 Telling Stories Together

Adventure Squad is a game where everyone makes the story. You don’t read from a script—you describe what’s happening and ask the players what they do.

Here’s an example:

> **GM**: “The town’s bell is ringing—something’s wrong at the beach. The mayor runs up, out of breath. ‘There’s a giant jellyfish tangled in the dock!’ What do you do?”

Then the players take turns responding:

> **Player 1 (Sprinkles the Cat)**: “I sprint to the water and try to calm the jellyfish using my Charm!”
> **Player 2 (Toby the Badger)**: “I get a fishing net and try to untangle the dock!”
> **GM**: “Great! Both of you roll a d6 and add your relevant stats…”

You’re not trying to beat the players. You’re giving them something exciting to do. You decide when a roll is needed and how hard something is. And you always cheer them on when they do something creative, kind, or clever.

---

### 🧪 Setting the Target Number

When you ask a player to roll, you also set the **Target Number (TN)**. This is the number they need to roll or beat with their d6 + stat.

Use this chart for guidance:

| **Challenge**                           | **Target Number (TN)** |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Very Easy                               | 2                      |
| Easy (a puddle jump)                    | 3                      |
| Medium (a cliff climb)                  | 4                      |
| Hard (hotwire a bulldozer)              | 5                      |
| Very Hard (negotiate with a robot bear) | 6                      |

If they roll **equal to or higher** than the TN, they succeed!

👉 Want to spice things up? You can roll a die yourself to oppose them. For example, “Roll against the crab’s Dexterity of 1d8!” Now it's a contest!

---

### 👣 The Flow of the Game

Every adventure follows a simple loop:

1. **You Describe** what’s happening.
2. **Players Say** what they want to do.
3. **You Decide** if they need to roll.
4. **They Roll** and find out what happens.
5. **You Describe** what happens next.

Keep things moving! If a player is stuck, offer choices:

> “You see a ladder, a vent, and a locked door. Which one do you want to try?”

If they roll low, don’t just say “No.” Say what goes wrong—or offer a twist:

> “Your paws slip on the wet rocks—you fall into the tide pool! Now you’re wet, but you spot something shiny under the water…”

Failure should always lead to a new chance for fun.

---

### 🌟 Teamwork and Getalong Tokens

Encourage collaboration by rewarding great teamwork or kind moments.

* **Teamwork Bonus**: If two or more characters help each other, they get **+1 to the roll.**
* **Getalong Token**: Give a player a Getalong Token when they do something especially sweet, generous, or brave.
  Players can spend one to:

  * Reroll any die
  * Automatically succeed on a roll
  * Help someone else, even when it’s not their turn

This keeps the focus on empathy and creativity!

---

### 🧰 The “Yes, And...” Rule

You are allowed to say “no,” but it’s more fun to say “yes, and…”

> “Can I build a trampoline from these vines?”
> “Yes, and you’ll need to roll Intelligence to do it in time before the flood hits!”

Let the players try wacky stuff. That’s the fun of it!

---

### 🔧 Your Role as the Referee

Sometimes players argue or get confused. That’s normal! Here’s what you can do:

* Be fair, not fussy. If a rule slows things down, make a quick call and keep going.
* Be generous. If someone’s having a tough time, give them a hint.
* Be clear. If you change a rule, say so out loud.
* Be kind. If someone’s nervous or quiet, invite them to speak when they’re ready.

You’re not the boss. You’re the guide. You’re their #1 fan.

---

### 🎉 It’s OK to Improvise!

You don’t need to plan every detail. Just know:

* The problem
* A few places and clues
* A fun twist or surprise
* One or two friendly or tricky NPCs

Then let the players lead the way.

You’re not writing a novel. You’re building a playground.

### Next Up...

You’re ready to dive into how to build an adventure from scratch! Next chapter: **The Four-Part Story Format** and how to keep the game exciting from start to finish.

---

Absolutely! Here’s the draft for **Chapter 3: Basic Rules (Quick Overview)** in the same Adventure Squad 2E style and 6th grade reading level:

---

## 🎲 Chapter 3: Basic Rules (Quick Overview)

This chapter is your quick-reference guide to how the rules work. Everything here is simple, fast, and built for fun.

Players only need one type of die: the classic **six-sided die (d6)**. The GM (that’s you!) can use the full set of RPG dice—like d4, d8, d12, and d20—to make the game more interesting.

Let’s break it down.

---

### 🧪 Rolling the Dice

Whenever a player wants to do something where there’s a chance of failure—like jumping a gap, calming a scared animal, or decoding a secret code—they roll a d6 and **add one of their stats**.

You’ll tell them what number they need to roll or beat. That number is called the **Target Number (TN).**

🎯 Here’s a helpful chart for setting the TN:

| **Task Difficulty**           | **Target Number** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Very Easy (No roll needed)    | 2 or less         |
| Easy (Climbing a tree)        | 3                 |
| Medium (Persuading someone)   | 4                 |
| Hard (Outrunning a rockslide) | 5                 |
| Very Hard (Piloting a blimp)  | 6                 |

🧠 Player rolls: `1d6 + the right Stat`.
🎉 If the result **meets or beats the TN**, success!
🙀 If it’s less, something goes wrong (but it should still be fun!).

---

### 📊 The Five Player Stats

Each player has 5 Stats. They start with **15 points** to spread between them however they want. Each stat goes from **1 to 6**.

| **Stat**         | **What It’s Used For**                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Agility**      | Running, jumping, dodging, climbing            |
| **Strength**     | Lifting, pushing, holding, carrying            |
| **Intelligence** | Solving puzzles, inventing, figuring stuff out |
| **Charm**        | Persuading, comforting, being brave or kind    |
| **Endurance**    | Staying calm, resisting cold/fear/tiredness    |

📘 Example:
Kai the Ferret wants to sneak past a sleepy guard dog. That’s Agility!
They roll `1d6 + 3` (their Agility stat). If the TN is 4, they need a total of 4 or more.

---

### 🔄 Turn-Based Gameplay

Adventure Squad is a **turn-based game.** That means each player takes one turn during a round. When all players have gone, it’s the GM’s turn to move time forward, add surprises, or describe what happens next.

On a player’s turn, they can usually do:

1. **One Action** – something cool, like climbing, using gear, talking, or helping a friend.
2. **One Move** – going from one part of the scene to another, like from the ladder to the roof.

💡 Some turns are big, like “I swing across the vines and grab the falling baby panda!”
Others are small, like “I take a step forward and peek around the corner.”

---

### 👯 Teamwork and Helping

If two or more characters help each other, give them a **Teamwork Bonus**:

> ✅ +1 to the roll

Anyone can help if they’re near and it makes sense. (You decide!)
Example: “While you balance the tower of crates, I hold it steady!” +1!

---

### 💖 Getalong Tokens

These magical little rewards help the players and encourage caring actions.

You (the GM) give them out when players:

* Help someone who’s scared
* Show empathy or teamwork
* Solve a problem without violence
* Do something brave, clever, or generous

📍 Each token can be used to:

* Reroll a die
* Automatically succeed on a roll
* Help a friend instantly, even out of turn

---

### 🎭 Roleplay and Free Play

Not everything needs a roll!

Let the players talk, explore, and make choices without always needing the dice. Use rolls when:

* There’s a chance of failure
* Something exciting could happen
* They’re doing something risky, hard, or dramatic

🎙️ If a player says, “I tell the puppy it’s okay and give them a hug,” don’t call for a Charm roll unless it’s a big deal.

---

### 🧙 GM Dice and Fun Extras

You can use your full dice set to:

* Make random decisions (roll a d4 for the number of clues in the room)
* Oppose a player’s action (like a crab’s d8 Speed vs. the player’s Agility)
* Add flair (roll a d12 to find out how many bees are in that hive!)

You’re the world. Your dice help it feel alive.

---

### 🛑 Rules for You

As GM, your job is to:

* Keep the game moving
* Say yes to fun ideas
* Only call for rolls when it matters
* Make sure everyone gets a turn
* Keep the spotlight moving and the energy up

If the players are laughing and thinking and trying—you're doing it right.

---

### ✨ Summary: A Turn at a Glance

Absolutely! Here's the full draft of **Chapter 4: The Four-Part Story Format** for Adventure Squad 2E:

---

## 🗺️ Chapter 4: The Four-Part Story Format

Every great Adventure Squad game is like a great story—and every story has a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.

This chapter teaches you how to build that story, step by step, using the **Four-Part Story Format**. It’s simple, fast, and fun—and it works every time.

Each adventure is made of four parts:

1. **Call to Action**
2. **Clue Hunt**
3. **The Twist**
4. **The Resolution**

Let’s go through each part and how to use it when you run a game.

---

### 1️⃣ Call to Action (Start the Adventure!)

This is where everything begins. The players are relaxing, playing, helping out in town, or doing something fun… when a problem shows up!

You, the GM, describe the event or mystery that pulls the heroes into the action.

🎯 Your job here is to:

* Introduce a fun problem (a missing item, a strange noise, a person in danger)
* Show the players where to go or who to talk to
* Build excitement without overwhelming them

🛎️ Examples:

* “The mayor runs up shouting, ‘There’s a strange glow coming from the forest!’”
* “Your animal rescue radio crackles to life: ‘We need help! A balloon is stuck on the windmill!’”
* “A mysterious letter slides under your door: ‘Meet me by the old fountain. Bring rope.’”

📘 Tip: Use an NPC the players already like to deliver the mission—it makes the hook feel personal!

---

### 2️⃣ Clue Hunt (Explore the World!)

Now the players get to explore. They visit places, ask questions, and discover weird or important things.

This is where you drop clues, surprises, and small puzzles or challenges.

🎯 Your job here is to:

* Let the players feel smart and curious
* Give them at least 2–3 different things to investigate
* Let each character shine by using different stats (Charm, Intelligence, Endurance, etc.)

🧩 Good clues or discoveries:

* A torn piece of cloth with slime on it
* Scratches on the walls that match a known claw shape
* A broken jar of honey with tiny pawprints leading away
* A robot squirrel that only speaks in riddles

📘 Tip: Always have a backup clue or hint ready in case the players get stuck!

---

### 3️⃣ The Twist (It’s Not What It Seems!)

Just when the players think they know what’s going on… BAM! Something changes.

The Twist adds surprise and drama. Maybe someone they trusted isn’t who they say they are. Maybe the weather turns. Maybe the villain shows up!

🎯 Your job here is to:

* Reveal something new that changes what the players think
* Raise the stakes!
* Give the players a decision to make, or a challenge to face

⚡ Examples:

* “The ‘missing’ puppy was hiding on purpose… because she found something even scarier in the mines.”
* “The runaway train wasn’t broken—it was hijacked by raccoons who want snacks!”
* “Just as you fix the elevator… the power goes out, and you hear something heavy upstairs.”

📘 Tip: The Twist doesn’t have to be mean or dark—just unexpected! Think of it like a fun plot twist in a cartoon.

---

### 4️⃣ The Resolution (The Squad Saves the Day!)

Now it’s time for the big finish! The players use what they’ve learned to fix the problem, help the people, or stop the disaster.

This is often a mix of quick-thinking, teamwork, and fun dice rolls.

🎯 Your job here is to:

* Set up a big problem they can solve
* Let every character be helpful in some way
* Celebrate when they succeed!

🛠️ Example Big Problems:

* They have to stack junk into a bridge before the flood hits
* They need to calm a scared dragon by singing in harmony
* They must sneak into a museum to return a missing artifact

Let the solution feel earned. If they remembered an earlier clue or used teamwork, give them something extra cool.

And if they mess up? That’s okay. Let the ending be messy, but never cruel. The goal is to finish the story and feel awesome doing it.

---

### 🪜 One Scene at a Time

You don’t need to plan every moment. Just sketch out:

* 1 starter scene (Call to Action)
* 2–3 clues or mini-challenges (Clue Hunt)
* 1 surprising event (Twist)
* 1 exciting final challenge (Resolution)

That’s it! You’re ready to play!

---

### 🧪 Sample Structure

Here’s how a real session might look:

1. **Call to Action**
   “Fred the armadillo bursts into HQ: ‘The candy train never arrived!’”

2. **Clue Hunt**

   * Follow the broken tracks into the hills
   * Interview a sleepy raccoon station worker
   * Find jellybean wrappers in a tree

3. **The Twist**
   “The candy wasn’t stolen… it was eaten by a runaway robot chef!”

4. **Resolution**
   Build a candy-lure trap and lead the robot back to the station. Everyone gets a caramel as thanks!

---

### 🛎️ Optional: Add a Cliffhanger!

Want to play again next time? End with a teaser:

> “As you celebrate with cupcakes, the lights flicker… and a mysterious symbol appears on the wall.”

---

🎉 You did it!

You now know how to build a complete Adventure Squad mission. Coming up next: **Creating Challenges** – how to make puzzles, problems, and obstacles that are just the right kind of tricky.

---
Here’s the full draft of **Chapter 5: Creating Challenges** for *Adventure Squad 2E*, written for clarity, fun, and a 6th grade reading level.

---

## 🧠 Chapter 5: Creating Challenges

Challenges are what make adventures exciting! Whether it’s crossing a broken bridge, calming a scared monster, or solving a puzzle to open a door, challenges give players something fun to do.

As the Game Master, you create these challenges—and then cheer when the players figure out how to overcome them!

Let’s look at how to make great challenges that are:

* Fun to try
* Fair for all players
* Just the right amount of tricky

---

### 🧩 What Makes a Good Challenge?

A good challenge has 3 key parts:

1. **A Clear Goal**
   What are the players trying to do? Climb the wall? Get past a robot guard? Stop the dam from breaking?

2. **A Problem or Obstacle**
   What makes it hard? Is something broken, locked, slippery, scary, or mysterious?

3. **A Cool Way to Solve It**
   Can players roll a stat? Use their gear? Team up? Talk their way through?

📘 Tip: Most challenges should be solvable in **1–2 rolls** or **creative thinking**. Let their ideas guide what works!

---

### ⚙️ Types of Challenges

Here are 5 fun types of challenges to drop into your adventures:

---

#### 1. **Physical Obstacles**

These challenges require movement, strength, or balance.

🧱 Examples:

* Climbing a cliff (Agility)
* Holding up a heavy gate (Strength)
* Crawling through a vent while carrying supplies (Endurance)

🛠️ GM Tip:
If the group is working together, let one roll and others give a +1 bonus!

---

#### 2. **Mental Puzzles**

These require clever thinking, memory, or attention to clues.

🧠 Examples:

* Solving a color pattern to open a door (Intelligence)
* Matching animal tracks to the right creature
* Decoding a riddle left by a mysterious inventor

🛠️ GM Tip:
Let players use real logic OR roll with Intelligence to get a hint. Both options are fun!

---

#### 3. **Social Situations**

These require talking, persuading, or calming people.

🗣️ Examples:

* Convincing a grumpy goat mayor to share info (Charm)
* Comforting a crying NPC after a storm
* Negotiating with a rival squad

🛠️ GM Tip:
Don’t make it just about the number—if they roleplay well, give advantage or lower the TN!

---

#### 4. **Team Tasks**

These challenges need teamwork—nobody can do it alone.

👯 Examples:

* One player holds the rope while another climbs
* A trio of players must activate three levers at once
* Working together to move a huge object

🛠️ GM Tip:
Team tasks are a great time to hand out **Getalong Tokens** and praise collaboration!

---

#### 5. **Creative Solutions**

Sometimes players will surprise you. Let them!

🎨 Example:

> “Can I make a zipline using vines and my helmet?”

🎯 Answer: YES! If it makes sense, roll for it.

🛠️ GM Tip:
When in doubt, ask them what Stat fits best. Trust their creativity!

---

### 🎯 Setting the Target Number

Use the same TN chart from before, depending on the difficulty:

| **Challenge** | **Target Number (TN)** |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Very Easy     | 2                      |
| Easy          | 3                      |
| Medium        | 4                      |
| Hard          | 5                      |
| Very Hard     | 6                      |

Let the players suggest how they’re solving it, and then **you** set the number based on how clever or risky it is.

---

### 🧰 Tools to Keep It Fair

Sometimes, players might feel stuck or frustrated. Here’s how to help:

* Give a **free clue** if they’re really struggling
* Let someone **use a Getalong Token** for an automatic success
* Say: “That’s a clever idea—I’ll lower the TN for that!”
* Don’t punish failure too hard—just move the story forward

📘 Good failure examples:

* “You don’t open the door, but you do hear voices inside.”
* “You fall into the stream—but hey, you find a cool shiny rock!”

---

### 🎲 Optional: Danger Clocks

To make some challenges more exciting, try adding a **Countdown**.

Example:

* “The machine is beeping faster. You have **3 rounds** before it overloads!”

Each turn, mark off one segment. When it hits 0, something big happens (but not something mean—just dramatic!).

---

### 🛎️ Challenge Checklist

✅ Clear goal
✅ Something tricky
✅ A way for anyone to help
✅ Fun to imagine
✅ Doesn’t stop the game cold

---

### 🔚 End on a High Note

After a challenge, **praise the team!** Whether they succeeded or not, if they played fairly and tried hard, they did great.

> “That was brilliant.”
> “I didn’t see that coming—awesome teamwork.”
> “You may be soaked, but you made it!”

Here’s the full draft of **Chapter 6: People, Places, and Pals** for *Adventure Squad 2E*:

---

## 🧍‍♂️🦝 Chapter 6: People, Places, and Pals

An adventure isn’t just challenges and dice rolls—it’s the people, places, and surprises along the way that bring the world to life.

This chapter helps you create:

* Memorable non-player characters (NPCs)
* Interesting and useful locations
* Fun and surprising encounters with creatures and critters

Let’s build your world, one friendly face and treehouse at a time.

---

### 🤝 People: How to Create NPCs

NPCs are any characters not controlled by the players. That includes:

* Helpful friends
* Grumpy shopkeepers
* Curious critters
* Scared townsfolk
* Mysterious mentors
* Goofy villains

You don’t need full stats for every NPC. Just know these 3 things:

1. **Who are they?**
   Name, animal type, role (Mayor? Inventor? Snack-seller?)

2. **What do they want?**
   Are they scared, stubborn, excited, sneaky?

3. **How do they act?**
   Talk fast? Always rhyming? Only speaks in beeps?

📘 Example NPC:
**Name**: Willow
**Animal**: Bat
**Role**: Sky Mail Pilot
**Want**: To deliver one last message before a big storm
**Quirk**: Talks like a movie narrator and uses lots of dramatic pauses

🛠️ GM Tip:
Give each new NPC one strong trait: a funny voice, a nervous habit, or a big hat.

---

### 🐢 NPC Types

You can use these as templates:

| **Type**        | **Use For**                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Friendly Helper | Gives clues, advice, or tools            |
| Silly Sidekick  | Tags along and makes things funnier      |
| Town Leader     | Requests help, gives missions            |
| Rival Squad     | Challenges the players (but isn’t evil!) |
| Wild Critter    | Needs help—or causes mischief            |
| Secret Villain  | Pretends to help, but has a hidden plan  |

---

### 🌍 Places: Where It All Happens

Your world can have cities, forests, mountains, oceans, caves, schools, or even outer space!

Every location should feel like it has a story to tell.

🛠️ Use the “Three Thing Rule”:
Describe 3 interesting details about a place to make it stick in players' minds.

📘 Example:
**The Treetop Market**

* Suspended rope bridges between leafy platforms
* Squirrels in tiny aprons selling nut-burgers
* A zipline with no brakes!

🎯 Your job is to make the setting feel alive. Let the players talk to people, touch things, ask questions, and explore!

---

### 🗺️ Types of Locations

Here are some great places to start with:

| **Type**      | **Ideas**                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe Zones    | HQ, treehouses, friendly towns                            |
| Mystery Sites | Caves, towers, ruins, ghost farms                         |
| Action Zones  | Runaway train, forest fire, crumbling bridge              |
| Puzzle Areas  | Locked vaults, mazes, pressure plates                     |
| Silly Spots   | Floating library, upside-down garden, junkyard playground |

📘 Tip: Draw a quick map or sketch if it helps your players imagine it!

---

### 🐊 Pals and “Monsters”

Adventure Squad doesn’t use classic “monsters” like other games. Instead, it uses:

* **Animal Allies** – Pals the players can meet or help
* **Misunderstood Foes** – Creatures that act badly, but have a reason
* **Obstacles with Personality** – Living plants, talking doors, sleepy giants

🛠️ When making a creature:

* Give it a cool trait (glows in the dark, can bounce really high)
* Decide what Stat it uses if it contests a player roll
* Figure out what it wants (attention, food, fun, safety)

🎭 You can make enemies without making them evil. Sometimes just talking is the best path forward.

---

### 🎨 Random NPC Quirks

Need a fast detail for an NPC or critter? Roll a d6:

1. Wears goggles, even indoors
2. Says “Wowza!” every time something happens
3. Collects shiny things
4. Only speaks in riddles
5. Sneezes lightning sparks
6. Has a backpack full of sandwiches

---

### 🌟 Making Your World Feel Real

Here’s how to build a world players care about:

✅ Let NPCs remember the players
✅ Change locations over time (the river freezes, the treehouse gets remodeled)
✅ Let players make choices that affect the world
✅ Reuse fun characters! Let them pop up again later

> “Oh no! It’s Flip-Flop the raccoon again! What’s he doing on the moon?!”

# 🎮 Chapter 7: How a Game Turn Works

Adventure Squad is a **turn-based game**, which means each player takes one turn before the next player goes. This keeps the action organized and makes sure everyone gets a moment to shine!

This chapter explains how turns work, how to keep things moving, and how to handle tricky moments at the table.

---

## 🔁 What Is a Turn?

Each round of the game is made up of player turns and GM responses. A **turn** is when one player gets to:
- **Do one main thing** (like talk, try a challenge, or use a tool)
- **Move to a new spot** if they want

🎲 Example:  
> “I race across the bridge and try to tie down the loose rope!”  
You might say, “Roll Agility!” and describe what happens next.

Once a player has finished their turn, the next player goes. When all players are done, it’s your turn as the GM to describe what’s happening next in the world.

---

## ⏱️ The Round Loop

Here’s the simple rhythm of a round:

1. **You describe** the current scene or danger  
2. **Player 1 goes**: “I try to fix the lever!”  
3. **Roll dice if needed**, resolve action  
4. **Player 2 goes**: “I calm the crying bird.”  
5. Keep going until all players have acted  
6. **GM responds**: You describe what changes and what happens next

This loop keeps going until the scene changes or the problem is solved.

---

## 🎭 What Can a Player Do?

On their turn, a player can:

- Try to solve a challenge (roll a d6 + stat)
- Talk to an NPC or creature
- Use a piece of gear
- Move to a new area
- Help another player
- Do something silly, clever, or unexpected

They **don’t** need to fight unless they want to. This game is about **actions**, not attacks.

📘 GM Tip: Encourage creativity. Let them try strange ideas as long as it fits the story.

---

## 🧠 When to Ask for a Roll

Ask a player to roll when:

- There’s a risk or chance of failure
- The outcome matters
- It’s exciting to find out what happens

If a player says, “I look around the cave,” you don’t need a roll. But if they say, “I try to leap across a chasm,” now it’s time to roll Agility!

📘 Tip: Never ask for a roll unless something fun could happen whether they fail or succeed.

---

## 🤝 Helping Each Other

Players can use their turn to **help** a teammate. That might give them:

- A **+1 bonus** on their next roll
- **Advantage** (roll twice, keep the higher result)
- A **Getalong Token** if it’s especially generous

Let teamwork shine. If a player has already used their turn, you can still let them help if it makes the scene better.

---

## 🧩 Handling Multiple Players

What if everyone wants to talk at once? Or they argue about who goes first?

🎯 Tips:
- Use a token or object to track whose turn it is
- Go clockwise, or use “popcorn order” (the current player picks who’s next)
- Let fast talkers wait a moment—invite quieter players to go early sometimes

Your goal is to keep turns **fair, fast, and fun**.

---

## 🧘 What to Do When It’s Not Your Turn

Help your players stay engaged even when it’s not their turn:

- Let them react, cheer, or offer ideas
- Let them plan or whisper to each other
- Let them roll if something affects everyone

This keeps the energy high and the game collaborative.

---

## 🎉 End of the Round

At the end of the round:

- Describe what changes in the scene
- Reveal new clues or trouble
- Reward clever thinking with a Getalong Token
- Set up the next moment of action!

Example:
> “You fix the lever just in time. The gate opens—and behind it, a big shadow rises...”

---

## 🛎️ Summary: Game Turn Checklist

✅ Player describes what they do  
✅ GM sets TN or rolls opposing dice  
✅ Player rolls and adds stat  
✅ GM describes what happens  
✅ Next player goes  
✅ After all turns, GM updates the scene

# 💡 Chapter 9: GM Tips & Techniques

Being a great Game Master doesn’t mean knowing every rule—it means helping everyone have a good time.

This chapter is packed with tips to help you run smooth, exciting, and heartwarming games. Whether it’s your first time or your fiftieth, these tricks will keep your players smiling and the story flowing.

---

## 🎙️ Tip #1: Say Yes (or “Yes, And...”)

When players ask to do something unexpected, try saying:

- “Yes!”  
- “Yes, and here’s what happens...”  
- “Yes, but it’s risky—roll to see what happens.”

Avoid hard “no” unless it breaks the game or ruins someone else’s fun.

📘 Example:
> “Can I ride the barrel down the river?”  
> “Yes, and roll Agility to see if you stay on!”

---

## 🗣️ Tip #2: Give Everyone a Chance

Some players talk a lot. Others are shy.

Make space by saying:
- “Let’s hear from someone who hasn’t gone yet.”
- “What’s your character thinking right now?”
- “Anyone want to help here?”

Let every hero have a moment in the spotlight.

---

## 🧪 Tip #3: Let Weird Ideas Work

If the players want to build a flying bike out of soup cans, give them a chance! That’s the heart of Adventure Squad.

You might say:
> “That’s wild. Roll Intelligence, and if you succeed, the bike wobbles but works!”

📘 Tip: Be a fan of their creativity—even when it’s bananas.

---

## ⏱️ Tip #4: Keep the Game Moving

Not every moment needs a rule or a roll. Keep the story flowing with:

- Quick descriptions
- “What do you do next?” questions
- Skipping over boring parts (“You walk for 2 hours… now you arrive at the gates!”)

Stay focused on the fun parts—action, emotion, discovery, teamwork.

---

## 💬 Tip #5: Use Voices and Props

You don’t have to be a performer—but fun voices, hats, or silly accents can bring the world to life.

Try:
- A high squeaky mouse voice
- A deep bear growl
- Holding a spoon as a “magic antenna”

Props and drawings also help younger players stay engaged.

---

## 📘 Tip #6: Take Notes

Keep a little notebook or page just for GM stuff:
- NPC names and quirks
- Things the players care about
- Clues you’ve dropped
- Unsolved mysteries

📘 Tip: Let players remind you of things too. It’s a shared story!

---

## 🧊 Tip #7: Use Safety Tools

Everyone should feel safe and respected. Talk to your players before the game about:

- What’s fun and what’s not
- When it’s okay to take a break
- How to handle uncomfortable moments

Use a simple system like the **X-Card**: anyone can tap a card to skip a scene or change the subject—no explanation needed.

---

## 🎉 Tip #8: Celebrate Everything

Celebrate:
- Big wins
- Clever solutions
- Funny fails
- Kind moments
- Player growth

Say:
- “That was awesome!”
- “Good thinking!”
- “You’re becoming a real squad!”

Positive feedback makes the game feel magical.

---
