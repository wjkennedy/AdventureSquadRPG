## Introduction

Welcome to Adventure Squad, a tabletop role-playing game designed to help you create your own stories, play as heroic animals, and explore exciting adventures with your friends. This handbook gives you everything you need to make your character and understand how to play. Whether this is your first RPG or you're a seasoned player, Adventure Squad is meant to be fast, friendly, and full of heart.

You don’t need to memorize everything—just start reading and refer back to sections as you need them. Most importantly, have fun and help others do the same!

### What You Need to Play

* A character sheet (you’ll make one soon!)
* A pencil
* A six-sided die (also called a d6)
* A group of friends: 1 Game Master (GM) and 1–5 players
* This book (or a copy of the rules)

That’s it! You’re ready to go.

## Chapter 1: Welcome to Adventure Squad

### What Is Adventure Squad?

Adventure Squad is a cooperative storytelling game where you and your friends take on the roles of heroic animals. Together, you’ll explore exciting places, solve problems, and help others. The game encourages teamwork, creativity, and kindness.

Unlike some games, Adventure Squad isn’t about fighting or defeating enemies. It’s about solving challenges, uncovering mysteries, and working together. You might save a baby bird from a tree, stop a runaway train, or uncover clues in a missing-pie case.

### What Makes Adventure Squad Special?

Adventure Squad focuses on:

* **Teamwork:** Helping each other is always a good idea.
* **Creativity:** There’s no one right answer—your ideas drive the story.
* **Kindness:** You can earn Getalong Tokens for showing empathy and cooperation.
* **Hero Moments:** Every character has a chance to shine.

### How Do You Play?

Players each create a character—an animal with special talents, tools, and personality. One player acts as the Game Master (GM), who sets the scene and guides the story. Everyone else plays their heroes, making choices and rolling dice to see what happens.

Most actions are resolved by rolling a six-sided die (d6) and adding one of your five stats. If the total meets or beats a Target Number (TN), your action succeeds!

### What Happens in a Game?

Each game is like a short story with four parts:

1. **Call to Action** – Something needs help or a problem begins.
2. **Clue Hunt** – The team explores, investigates, and gathers information.
3. **Twist** – A surprise or big challenge appears.
4. **Resolution** – The team solves the problem and celebrates.

That’s the structure of an adventure—but what happens inside it is completely up to you and your team.

Adventure Squad is flexible and open. You can play one short game or a long series of connected missions (called a campaign). No matter what, every game is a chance to tell a story together and be a hero.

Chapter 2: Creating Your Hero

In Adventure Squad, you play as a brave animal hero with unique talents, gear, and personality. This chapter walks you through everything you need to create your character.

Step 1: Pick Your Animal Type

Are you a loyal dog? A clever cat? A speedy rabbit? Choose any animal you like—real or imaginary—as long as it makes sense for the story your group wants to tell. Your animal type doesn’t affect your stats, but it adds flavor to your character and helps you decide how they move and act.

Step 2: Choose a Role

Your Role is your hero’s job or special focus. It gives you a general idea of how your hero helps the team.
Examples include:

Rescue Specialist

Inventor

Tracker

Medic

Scout

Performer

You can also make up your own role. The role is just a fun title that describes what your hero is good at.

Step 3: Choose a Special Skill

Your Special Skill is a unique ability that helps in adventures. It could be something physical, mental, or magical. Just pick one, and describe how it works. Your GM will help you keep it balanced if needed.
Examples:

Flying

Super Strength

Digging

Healing Touch

Tech Genius

Talking to Birds

Use your imagination! The skill should be useful, but not so powerful it solves every problem.

Step 4: Choose Personality Traits

Pick 2–3 traits that describe how your hero behaves. These help guide your roleplaying and can earn Getalong Tokens when you use them well.
Examples:

Brave

Shy

Curious

Silly

Kind

Loyal

You can change or add to your traits as your character grows.

Step 5: Distribute Your Stats

You have 15 points to divide among five stats. Each starts at 0 and can go up to 6:

Agility – running, jumping, dodging

Strength – lifting, pushing, pulling

Intelligence – solving puzzles, noticing details

Charm – talking, encouraging, persuading

Endurance – staying calm, doing hard work for a long time

Assign your points based on what your hero is best at. Every action you take in the game will involve one of these stats.

Step 6: Choose Gear

Give your hero 2–3 special items or tools that make sense for their role. Gear isn’t just for combat—it helps solve problems, reach places, or interact with the world.
Examples:

Grappling hook

Medkit

Tool belt

Binoculars

Jetpack

Notebook and magnifying glass

You can also invent gear that matches your hero’s personality and skill.

Step 7: Write a Short Backstory

Where is your hero from? Why do they want to help others? Have they solved any mysteries before? Just write a few sentences.

Backstories help the GM build adventures that connect to your character.

Once you’ve finished all the steps, you’re ready to fill out your character sheet and begin your first mission!

## Chapter 3: Your Character Sheet

The character sheet is where you keep track of everything about your hero: what they can do, what makes them special, and how they grow over time. This chapter walks you through each part of the sheet so you can fill it out and use it during your adventures.

### What Is a Character Sheet?
It’s a one-page summary of your character. When you play, it helps you remember your stats, abilities, gear, and any cool things you’ve earned. The GM might ask you questions about your sheet during the game, so it’s good to keep it nearby.

### Sections of the Sheet

#### 1. Character Info
- **Name:** Give your hero a name that fits their personality.
- **Animal Type:** What kind of animal are you? (Dog, Cat, Rabbit, etc.)
- **Role:** Choose a job or specialty like Rescue Specialist, Medic, or Inventor.
- **Special Skill:** This is your unique power or ability. Examples: Flying, Super Strength, Digging.

#### 2. Personality
- **Traits:** Write 2–3 words that describe your personality (e.g., Brave, Curious, Funny).
- **Backstory:** Where did your hero come from? What drives them to help others?

#### 3. Stats
You have 15 points to divide among five stats. Each one starts at 0 and can go up to 6.
- **Agility** (moving, dodging, jumping)
- **Strength** (lifting, pulling, holding on)
- **Intelligence** (puzzles, clues, learning things)
- **Charm** (talking, persuading, being kind)
- **Endurance** (long tasks, staying calm, not giving up)

Write your numbers next to each stat. These add to your rolls when you try something.

#### 4. Gear
List the tools or items your character carries. These don’t need to be long lists—just the helpful or special things you might use in adventures. Examples: jetpack, grappling hook, emergency snacks.

#### 5. Getalong Tokens
Start with 1 token. You earn more during play for being kind or helping others. You can use them for rerolls or to auto-succeed at something really important.

#### 6. Titles and Achievements (Optional)
As your hero completes missions or grows, you might earn a fun title like "Bridge Builder" or "Puzzle Solver." Add these here!

### Keeping Your Sheet Updated
Whenever something changes—you level up, earn gear, or spend a Getalong Token—make sure to update your sheet. This helps you remember what your hero can do and makes the game smoother.

### Leveling Up
When your GM says it’s time to level up, you might get:
- 1 extra point to add to a stat
- A new piece of gear
- A new title or ability

Write any updates directly on your character sheet. You’re becoming a true hero!

## Chapter 4: How to Play

This chapter teaches you how the rules work so you can jump into the game and start adventuring right away. The rules are simple and meant to keep the game moving and fun.

### Rolling the Dice
Most of the time, you roll a six-sided die (d6) to see if you succeed at a challenge. The GM sets a **Target Number (TN)** between 3 (easy) and 6 (hard).

- Roll 1–2: Miss
- Roll 3–5: Mixed success
- Roll 6 or higher (with bonuses): Full success

If your stat helps with the action, add it to your roll. For example, if you're climbing and you have +2 Agility, roll the d6 and add 2 to the result.

### Actions and Turns
On your turn, you can describe what your hero does. There’s no strict list of actions—you can try anything that fits the story.

A typical turn includes:
- Saying what you want to do
- Rolling the die if it’s risky or exciting
- Using teamwork or gear if it helps
- Letting the GM describe what happens next

### Using Stats
Your stats help you succeed. Here’s when to use them:
- **Agility** for moving fast, dodging, or jumping
- **Strength** for lifting, pulling, or holding on
- **Intelligence** for solving puzzles or understanding clues
- **Charm** for persuading others or being kind
- **Endurance** for staying calm or pushing through hard tasks

### Getalong Tokens
These are special tokens you can use to:
- Reroll a die
- Automatically succeed on something important
- Help another player by giving them a reroll

You earn tokens for showing kindness, teamwork, or creative thinking.

### Teamwork
Two or more heroes can work together. If they do, one rolls with a +1 bonus. You can also use your turn to help another hero succeed.

### Hero Moments
If a player has a great idea, creative solution, or roleplays really well, the GM can grant a Hero Moment. This lets the player do something amazing or impossible (like making a leap across a giant gap or convincing a grumpy NPC to help).

### Safety and Fun
It’s important that everyone feels safe and included. If something makes someone uncomfortable, they can speak up and change the scene.

Keep the game friendly and fun. You’re all here to tell a story and be awesome together!

## Chapter 5: The Four-Part Adventure

Every game of Adventure Squad is structured like a four-part story. This format helps everyone stay on the same page and makes it easy for the Game Master to guide the team through a fun, satisfying journey.

### Part 1: Call to Action
This is where the story begins. The team hears about a problem or sees something that needs help. It could be a missing item, someone in danger, or a mystery to solve.

Ask questions like:
- Who needs help?
- Where are we?
- What do we know so far?

This part sets the tone for the game and gives the players a reason to jump into action.

### Part 2: Clue Hunt
Now the team explores! Players can investigate, ask questions, look for clues, or talk to characters. This part is about learning more and coming up with ideas.

Let players:
- Split up or stick together
- Use their special skills and gear
- Roll dice to find useful information

This part is fun because players get to use their creativity and teamwork.

### Part 3: The Twist
Here’s where the story takes a turn. Maybe the problem is bigger than it looked. Maybe the missing pie was stolen on purpose—or the storm knocked out the bridge!

The GM reveals a new challenge or surprise. Players must now work together to come up with a new plan and solve the real problem.

Encourage players to:
- Think outside the box
- Combine skills and gear
- Be brave and support each other

### Part 4: The Resolution
This is the final part of the story. The team puts their plan into action and wraps up the mission. They roll dice, use their gear, and bring all their skills together.

When the challenge is solved:
- Let the team celebrate
- Give Getalong Tokens or Titles if earned
- Ask: What did we learn? Who did we help?

You’ve finished the adventure—and maybe inspired the next one!

### Optional: Add a Cliffhanger
Want to keep things going? End the story with a new question or mystery! Maybe someone leaves behind a strange clue. Maybe a shadowy figure was watching from the trees.

Cliffhangers make players excited to return for the next session.

### Summary
The Four-Part Adventure format helps you:
1. Start strong with a problem to solve
2. Explore and gather clues
3. Face a fun twist or surprise
4. Solve the challenge and celebrate

You can follow this structure or mix it up—but it’s a great way to tell exciting, complete stories every time you play.

## Chapter 6: Leveling Up and Hero Growth

As you go on more adventures, your hero will grow stronger, wiser, and more prepared for whatever comes next. This chapter explains how characters level up and unlock new gear, abilities, and titles.

### When Do You Level Up?
Your Game Master (GM) will tell you when it's time to level up. This usually happens after a major mission, when your team has finished a full adventure, or when everyone has had a chance to shine.

Leveling up is a way to celebrate your progress and get new tools for future challenges.

### What Happens When You Level Up?
When you level up, you usually get:
- **+1 point** to add to any one stat
- **1 new piece of gear** that fits your character
- **A new title** that reflects something awesome your hero did

Your GM might also let you unlock a **Hero Trait**—a special ability or bonus that sets you apart.

### Gear Upgrades
New gear can come from the story (like a gift from a thankful town) or from your own ideas. Gear should help in specific situations and match your role or personality.

Examples:
- A weatherproof cloak that helps in rain
- A scanner that finds hidden tunnels
- A sparkly charm that gives you confidence in social scenes

### Titles
Titles are fun, creative names you earn through play. You might get a title for:
- Solving a tricky puzzle
- Leading a successful plan
- Helping another player shine

Examples:
- "Tunnel Navigator"
- "Storm Whisperer"
- "Kind-Hearted Hero"

Titles don’t change your stats, but they can remind everyone what makes your hero special.

### Hero Traits (Optional Rule)
If your group wants to use Hero Traits, you can unlock one after every 2–3 level-ups. A Hero Trait is like a mini-superpower that gives you a small bonus or fun new action.

Examples:
- **Quick Learner:** Once per game, reroll an Intelligence check.
- **Fearless:** You ignore the first failure on a scary challenge.
- **Team Booster:** When helping another player, give them +2 instead of +1.

Your GM can help you make up new traits that fit your character’s journey.

### Keeping Track
Make sure to update your character sheet when you:
- Add stat points
- Gain new gear
- Write down a title
- Unlock a Hero Trait

Growth is part of the fun. Celebrate your hero’s journey and look back at how far they’ve come. You’ve earned it!
---
## Chapter 7: Working as a Team

Adventure Squad is built around teamwork. Your hero is never alone—you’re part of a team of brave animals who help each other succeed. This chapter gives you tools to play as a team and have more fun together.

### Helping Others
On your turn, you can choose to help another player instead of taking your own action. When you help:
- Explain how you’re helping (using a skill, gear, or encouraging words)
- Add +1 to their roll

Helping is a great way to support your friends and earn Getalong Tokens for teamwork.

### Team Combos
Sometimes the whole group wants to tackle a big challenge together. The GM can treat this as a "Team Combo."

To do a Team Combo:
- Each player describes what their hero does
- Everyone rolls (or one player rolls with a big bonus)
- The GM narrates how the team’s actions combine to solve the challenge

Examples:
- One pup distracts the guard while another unlocks the door
- One hero jumps across the gap and throws a rope back to the others
- A flying friend lifts a heavy object while the team guides them safely

### Planning Together
Some missions are easier with a plan. Before jumping into action, take a minute to talk as a team:
- What do we know?
- What’s the goal?
- Who should do what?

Planning doesn’t take away from the fun—it makes your actions smarter and more exciting.

### Celebrate Each Other
When someone does something awesome, say so! Give high-fives (real or virtual). Share compliments. Let your teammates know they’re doing great.

The more you support each other, the better the adventure feels.

### Getalong Tokens and Teamwork
You earn Getalong Tokens for showing teamwork and kindness. Here’s how to use them together:
- Spend your token to help a teammate reroll
- Pool tokens to auto-succeed on a group task
- Give a token to someone who did something brave or kind

### Everyone Gets a Turn
If someone’s been quiet, ask what their hero is doing. Make space for everyone’s ideas. A great team lifts each other up.

Adventure Squad is about more than just solving problems—it’s about doing it together.
