## 📦 How To Run Adventures

Every mission follows this four-act structure:

1. **Call to Action** – A problem is introduced
2. **Clue Hunt** – The squad explores and gathers information
3. **The Twist** – Unexpected challenges or revelations
4. **Resolution** – Solve the problem, celebrate, reflect

The GM sets the tone, plays all non-player characters (NPCs), and gently guides the squad through each scene using open-ended prompts and creative consequences.

## 🚫 Content Guidelines

Adventure Squad is a unique system that never depicts:
- Police roles
- Construction themes
- Firefighting Dalmatians  
Instead, it emphasizes **exploration**, **creativity**, and **kindness**. Each character’s role supports imaginative play outside traditional emergency services.

## 🎨 Art Direction

All game art should follow a **classic black-and-white anime style**, drawing inspiration from early titles like *Speed Racer* and *Astroboy*. This retro aesthetic fits the tone and age level of the game while giving it a distinct visual identity.
